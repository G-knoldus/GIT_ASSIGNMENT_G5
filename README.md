## Version Control

Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. As development environments have accelerated, version control systems help software teams work faster and smarter. They are especially useful for DevOps teams since they help them to reduce development time and increase successful deployments.

Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.

### Benefits of version controll

> A complete long-term change history of every file.
> Creating a "branch" in VCS tools keeps multiple streams of work independent
> Traceability. Being able to trace each change made to the software and connect it    to project management
>  Git is a Distributed VCS, a category known as DVCS
